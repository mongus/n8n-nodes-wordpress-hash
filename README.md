# n8n-nodes-wordpress-hash

This is an n8n community node. It lets you generate and verify WordPress-compatible password hashes in your n8n workflows.

WordPress password hashing (via the `wordpress-hash-node` library) provides hashing and verification compatible with WordPress user passwords. This is useful for migrations, integrations, and any workflow where you need to hash or validate passwords against WordPress.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
